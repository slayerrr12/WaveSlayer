# AI-CHATBOT

This is a simple AI chatbot project built using Python and natural language processing techniques. The chatbot uses a pre-trained language model to understand and generate responses to user input.

## Requirements

To run this chatbot, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. 



## Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install tk
pip3 install customtkinter
pip install pillow
pip install mysql-connector-python
```


## Usage

To start the chatbot, simply run the `chatbot.py` script using Python:

```
python DRIVER_CODE.py
```

Once the chatbot is running, you can start a conversation by typing in your message and pressing Enter. The chatbot will generate a response based on the message you have provided.


This will generate a new set of model files that the chatbot will use to generate responses.
